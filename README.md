This project is a simple E-commerce app developed as part of the Software Development and Mobile Systems course at LETI - ISEP.

It was created in a team of two with the goal of learning how to build android mobile applications using Java.

ðŸ’¡ Note: The project was initially hosted on a university account. After completion, it was migrated to this personal repository â€” hence the single commit history.

ðŸ’¡ Note 2: Since this was a learning project, some features no longer work â€” such as adding a photo to a product (which relied on Firebase storage that now requires a paid plan), as well as a few others that broke due to version incompatibilities. I'm keeping the project here because it was the first app I ever worked on, and the one that truly helped me learn how to program.
